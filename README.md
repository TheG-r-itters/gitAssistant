# GitAssistant

The aim of this project is to build a WebApp that serves as an assistant for
 GIT.

Although the git online documentation is very complete and helpful, many times
 developer needs to find the right command with the right options for some
 operation he knows, but for which the commands is  not known or is not
 remembered.

This assistant will receive a prompt asking for the operation to be done, and
 using some NLP processing it will be able to return the right commands and
 documentation reference.
